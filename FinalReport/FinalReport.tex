\section{Abstract}

Provide a one paragraph summary of your entire project. Very briefly mention why this technique is important, what makes it challenging, what your solution was, and what your results were. This is essentially condensing each section listed below into one or two sentences. You may want to actually write this section last.

\section{Introduction}

Give a high level overview of your project. Why is it important? What makes it challenging/difficult? Describe what will follow in the rest of the report. This section should be several paragraphs long (roughly one plus column).

\section{Related Work}

Discuss what has previously been done in this area. What existing and similar solutions exists? What have other people done? Where did those existing solutions fall short? You should be citing your references the most in this section (though you will probably need to cite in the first three or four sections). The length of this section will vary.

\section{Problem Statement}

Go into technical detail about the challenges in this area. What specifically makes it difficult? What shortcomings did other techniques have?

\section{Problem Solution}

Now go into technical detail about how your solution is implemented. Be sure to specifically mention what each shader is doing, what each pass is doing, and what graphical objects are being used.

\section{Results}

How did your implementation work? Did it accomplish what it set out to do?

\section{Conclusion}

In a couple paragraphs, summarize all of the above sections. Give any final thoughts on lessons learned, challenges that arose and how they were overcome, and next steps to take to future work.
