In this project we implement a height field fluid simulation that runs in realtime The height
Field information is stored in two, two dimensional arrays. One for column
height and one for column velocity. These columns are updated each frame.
Each column calculates the force on it due to the four surrounding columns
with the equation, f = c2*(u[i+1,j]+u[i-1,j]+u[i,j+1]+u[i,j-1]{ 4u[i,j])/h2. C
represents the speed of a wave and h represents the width of a column. This
equation is derived from a reduction of realistic wave equations to two di-
mensions. Our simulation takes place on a large scale with each column
representing a 1 meter by 1 meter column of water. After the force is calcu-
lated it is applied to the velocity of each column. The force is multiplied by
the amount of time that has passed since the last update, 1/60th of a second
in our case. This ensures that steps remain constant even if framerate is
changed. After all velocities have been updated the height of each column
is modified by adding velocity multiplied by the time step. This process of
forward Euler integration can lead to feedback loops if not controlled so we
implement damping and clamping. Velocity is damped by a factor of 0.99
each step and column height is bounded between -100 and 100 although with
the damping factor these extremes are rarely reached.

An important part of the simulation is using various boundary conditions to 
mimic realistic wave reflection off of rigid surfaces or mimic large bodies of 
water. Our implementation has the option to perform four different boundary 
conditions using a variety of techniques. The first technique to be implemented 
is called boundary clamping. When using clamping, the columns on the edges of 
the height field use themselves in place of any missing columns. This creates 
an effect similar to water reflecting off of a rigid vertical surface with a 
minimal velocity on columns around the edges of the height field. The next 
technique is called wrapping boundaries. Boundaries that wrap use the columns 
on the opposite side of the height field to calculate their velocities. This is 
useful for creating an effect similar to how water reacts in a large body by 
copying one height field in a checkerboard pattern to easily create a large 
body without having to process an excess of columns which could effect 
framerate. Finally, the last two techniques use a ghost boundary for 
reflecting. These techniques are similar to clamping and perform similarly, but 
instead of a column using itself as a reference when there is no column on one 
or more sides of it, a ghost column is used. In one implementation, the average 
height of the columns in the height field is used creating an extremely rigid 
outer wall of columns around the height field. The other implementation uses 
the slope between the outermost and second most outer columns to determine the 
height of the ghost. This method can be very realistic, but it has one inherent 
flaw. If the heights of the corners of the height field are not equal to the 
average height of all the columns, there will be a slant leading to the corners 
in question. This is because the heights of the corners never changes in this 
implementation due to how they are calculated. There are some simple hacks to 
avoid this such as setting the corners to be equal to the average at the start 
or using clamping only for the corners, but we left this flaw in our program to 
display it.

Object interaction is implemented with a cube. Our cube is therefore
3
drawn with edges parallel to the edges of our columns. During each step of
the simulation we find the location of the corners of the cube with respect
to the indices of our columns. This allows us to compare the cubes height
with that of the water. By subtracting the height of the base of the cube
from the height of the water and clamping between 0 and cube width we
calculate the amount of water displaced by the cube. The displacement of
each column is stored in another 2-dimensional array and by comparing the
new displacement with the old we are able to calculate the change in displacement of water by the cube. Once the total displacement and the change
in displacement are known these values are used to calculate the force on the
cube and the change in water level around the cube respectively. Any change
in displaced water is added or subtracted directly to the columns surrounding the cube. Our height field inside the cube is not modified allowing water
to cover the cube should it fall below the water level. Because the height
field is not modified on the inside of the cube a feedback loop can occur.
The displaced water is added to the surrounding columns which 
ow inward
increasing the amount of displaced water by the cube, adding more water to
the surrounding columns. This was solved in two ways. The first option sets
the height of each internal column to halfway up the cube. This allows the
following update due to column velocity to pull a column above the cube and
prevents the feedback loop but gives the water a much more viscous appearance with it clinging to the cube, creating depressions and mounds in the
surface when the cube is dropped and raised respectively. The second option
is to use the average water level instead of the local column height. This
leads to realistic simulations when the water is relatively 
at but leads to
disconnected water ripples and cube movement if the surface is far above or
below average at that location. Once the water is updated the cube is moved
using Forward Euler integration and standard physics equations. Force due
to water is calculated with density*gravity*displacement and both it and
gravity are applied to velocity and then velocity to cube location.

It is also important to ensure water is not added or removed from the
simulation. To do this we initially calculate an average volume for a column.
Upon each step we recalculate this average and add or subtract the difierence
from every column. This prevents small errors in calculation from drastically
altering the volume of our 
fluid over time.

<br>
The final step is drawing the height field. To do this we created an
additional array that contains a point representing the top left corner of
each column. The x and z components were the indices of a location and
4
the y the height. This array was transferred to the GPU via and VBO and
VAO to as points. A geometry shader then took each point and expanded it
into a column, adding sides with specifed widths and a height determined by
the height of each point. The columns were then shaded with Blinn-Phong
shading. A simple set of Blinn-Phong shaders were applied to the cube as
well, completing our lighting.
